# Requirements
* A CUDA compatable GPU with memoery not less than 6GB is recommended for training. For testing only, a CUDA compatable GPU may not be required.

* Tensorflow. Install tensorflow following instructions from https://www.tensorflow.org/install. Tested version is 1.7.0.

* NiftyNet. Install it by following instructions from http://niftynet.readthedocs.io/en/dev/installation.html or simply typing:
```bash
pip install niftynet
```

# How to use
## 1, Use pre-trained models for fetal brain localization and segmentation

* For fetal brain localization, run

```bash
python test.py detect cfg_data_detect.txt
```


* For fetal brain segmentation, run

```bash
python test.py segment cfg_data_segment.txt
```

* You can edit `cfg_data_detect.txt` and `cfg_data_segment.txt` to customize the input and output image names.
